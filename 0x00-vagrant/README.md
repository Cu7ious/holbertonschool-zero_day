# 0x00. Vagrant

* Virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer.
* Vagrant is a tool for managing virtual machines via command line interface. It provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments.
* Vagrant was written by HashiCorp 
* Ubuntu is a Linux based (Debian) open source operating system
* The word "Ubuntu" means "humanity" or "humanness" (Translated from Zulu language)
* How to use VMs with Vagrant:
	* vagrant init image_name // will create Vagrantfile
	* vagrant up  		  // will run the VM
	* vagrant ssh  		  // will ssh to the VM
	* vagrant halt		  // will shut down the VM
	* vagrant box list	  // will print the list of boxes available on the computer

* uname command prints system information, for ex on Ubuntu `$ uname` will print `Linux`
* In the jargon of computer security, "Day Zero" is the day on which the interested party (presumably the vendor of the targeted system) learns of the vulnerability. Up until that day, the vulnerability is known as a zero-day vulnerability. Similarly, an exploitable bug that has been known for thirty days would be called a 30-day vulnerability. Once the vendor learns of the vulnerability, the vendor will usually create patches or advise workarounds to mitigate it.
